## C++ : Dummy Guide

This is a repository about C++ fundamentals. It is supposed to serve as a simple/quick reference guide and it contains a brief summary about the main concepts and a few examples and exercises. Additionaly, as I am also learning/studying much of the content here, the code and explanations may not (probably not) be the most efficient, readable and clear, so if you have suggestions of improvements, please feel free to contribute.

#### Where to run your code?
In case you want to quickly run and test your code, you can run it using the following websites:
* [C++ shell](http://cpp.sh/)
* [GDB Online Debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
